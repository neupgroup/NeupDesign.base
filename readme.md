# What is NeupDesign?
-> Simply, an idea of to make things look good. Just wanted to build up things quick, made an CSS that can be copied and pasted, and which would just work.
-> And, the flexibility of color, you've your color, force it, or allow the user to use their own color.
-> That's the idea, and this is the result.
-> Also, accessibility. Wanted to make design also for non JS device. But, now thinking of dropping this idea because it got too complicated.

## That's all.
-> Got nothing more to say. 

## Contributions/Suggestions?
-> Wanna contribute, feel free to do so.
-> Suggestions are really welcomed.
-> Consider the lack of knowledge might though prevent in incorporating, but will try.
